# jigsAWE
This is a multiplayer online jigsaw puzzle game.  It was built using React, Redux, HTML5 canvas and some math.  The foundation for the drag and drop functionality and general puzzle calculations came from a tutorial by Brad Manderscheid (https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-an-html5-canvas-tile-swapping-puzzle--active-10747).  Some adjustments were made to account for different offsets and the general restructuring of the app.

## Installation
Installation is quite simple.  Clone the repo then npm install.  Default port is 7777, unless the process env. variable is set.

## Playing the game
Check this puzzle out on heroku:

http://jigsawe.herokuapp.com/

It's jigsaw!  Select one of the images, then click start.  A URL will be provided, which you can send to others - anyone with this link will be able to join your game and you can move pieces around to collaboratively solve the puzzle.  

You can restart at any time by clicking on the restart link.  If you restart the puzzle you will be assigned to another room, so others working on your previous puzzle will not lose their work.

## Colaboration
Feel free to add and extend!  This needs an overall design overhaul and implementing enhanced user functionality would be really nice.  Allow users to save progress, to join multiple puzzles, to have competitions and scoring, configuration options, ability to add their own images...  Possibilities are endless...
